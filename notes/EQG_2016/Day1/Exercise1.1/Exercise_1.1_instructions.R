###(revised Jan 2012)
##Stage 1_Get data into R and estimate heritability by regression
##Get your data into R by following the following steps
#Save the file R_inland_snake_data.txt to your desktop or folder of choice
#Now, set your working directory by
#putting your windows username or specifying the folder you created in the following 	statement.
#Be sure and use the / not the \ spacing convention!
setwd('C:/Documents and Settings/arnolds/Desktop/R wd')
#Now read in your data
thamnophis = read.table('R_inland_snake_data.txt',header=TRUE)

#Attach the data frame to the local environment
attach(thamnophis)

##Calculate the heritability of "body"
#Create a vector of all the unique family codes
family.list=unique(family)
family.list
#We will now calculate the heritability of the body vertebrae. We will need to 
#do two things, create a vector of all of the mom's vertebrae counts, and create
#a vector of all the kid's vertebrae counts averaged over families. 
moms=NULL
kids=NULL
#Go through a loop with i equal to a each successive value in family.list; copy from �for� to �}� and paste in R console
for (i in family.list){ 
	byfam=subset(body,family==i) #Create a vector of body vertebrae counts for family i
	moms=rbind(moms,byfam[1]) #Save the moms count as the next element in the vector "moms"
	kids=rbind(kids,mean(byfam[-1], na.rm=TRUE)) #Save the mean of the kids count as the next element in the vector "kids" (you are excluding the 1st element of the vector, which is the mom)
	}
#Linear regression of kids on moms, will save a bunch of stuff in ls; to see the summary statistics run "summary(ls)", we especially want the slope, which is stored in ls$coefficients
	ls=lsfit(moms,kids) 
	
 	plot(moms, kids, col='blue', pch=19, cex=1.5)

#Extract the 2nd coefficient from the object "coefficients" in "ls"
 slope=ls$coefficients[2] 
#the heritability estimate is twice the slope because we are using just one parent, not both
h.squared=2*slope  
h.squared

	abline(ls, lwd=5)
 
##Calculate the heritability of "tail"
#Create a vector of all the unique family codes
family.list=unique(family)
#We will now calculate the heritability of the tail vertebrae. We will need to 
#do two things, create a vector of all of the mom's vertebrae counts, and create
#a vector of all the kid's vertebrae counts averaged over families. 
moms=NULL
kids=NULL
#Go through a loop with i equal to a each successive value in family.list 
for (i in family.list){ 
	byfam=subset(tail,family==i) #Create a vector of tail vertebrae counts for family i
	moms=rbind(moms,byfam[1]) #Save the moms count as the next element in the vector "moms"
	kids=rbind(kids,mean(byfam[-1], na.rm=T)) #Save the mean of the kids count as the next element in the vector "kids" (you are excluding the 1st element of the vector, which is the mom)
	}
#Linear regression of kids on moms, will save a bunch of stuff in ls; to see the summary statistics run "summary(ls)", we especially want the slope, which is stored in ls$coefficients
	ls=lsfit(moms, kids) 
#Extract the 2nd coefficient from the object "coefficients" in "ls"
	slope=ls$coefficients[2] 
	h.squared=2*slope
 	plot(moms, kids, col='blue', pch=19, cex=1.5)
	abline(ls, lwd=5)

#Stage 2_Use bootstrapping to make an interval estimate of heritability
##Make a function that can quickly calculate the heritability for each trait
# In the user-defined function h2, V is the name of the trait whose heritability will be estimated
h2=function(V){
family.list=unique(family)
moms=NULL
kids=NULL
for (i in family.list){
	byfam=subset(V, family==i) 
	moms=rbind(moms, byfam[1]) 
	kids=rbind(kids, mean(byfam[-1], na.rm=TRUE)) 
		}
plot(moms, kids, col='blue', pch=19, cex=1.5)
	ls=lsfit(moms, kids)
	abline(ls, lwd=5)

	slope=ls$coeff[2]
	h.squared=2*slope
	h.squared
	}

#test new function called h2:
h2(body)
h2(ilab)
h2(tail)

##Bootstrap the heritability of "body"
#Hit �Enter� to escape from the cycle of plots
family.list=unique(family)
h2.all=NULL
for (j in 1:1000){
moms=NULL
kids=NULL
family.list.boot=sample(family.list,replace=TRUE)
for (i in family.list.boot){
	byfam=subset(body,family==i) 
	moms=rbind(moms,byfam[1]) 
	kids=rbind(kids,mean(byfam[-1],na.rm=TRUE))
	}
		
	ls=lsfit(moms, kids)
	slope=ls$coeff[2]
	h.squared=2*slope
#Save the heritability of replicate i as the ith element in vector h2.all
	h2.all=rbind(h2.all,h.squared)  
	#Graph showing the variation in points sampled
	plot(moms,kids,xlim=c(150,180),ylim=c(150,180)) 
#Superimpose on that graph the regression ls
	abline(ls$coefficients)	
	}
#Plot a histogram of the heritability estimates and corresponding summary stats 
hist(h2.all) 
mean(h2.all)
var(h2.all) #Our estimate of the sampling variance of the mean
sd(h2.all)  #Our estimate of the standard error of the mean

##Create a program h2boot that calculates bootstrap values so we can get the value for #each variable quickly; copy the following statements all the way thru the 3rd �}� and #paste into console
family.list=unique(family)
h2boot=function(V,boot.reps=1000){
h2.all=NULL
for (j in 1:boot.reps){
moms=NULL
kids=NULL
family.list.boot=sample(family.list,replace=TRUE) #This is the key to bootstrapping
for (i in family.list.boot){
	byfam=subset(V,family==i) 
	moms=rbind(moms,byfam[1]) 
	kids=rbind(kids,mean(byfam[-1],na.rm=TRUE))
	}
		
	ls=lsfit(moms, kids)
	slope=ls$coeff[2]
	h2=2*slope
#Save the heritability of replicate i as the ith element in vector h2.all
	h2.all=rbind(h2.all,h2)  
	
	plot(moms,kids,xlim=c(min(V,na.rm=TRUE),max(V,na.rm=TRUE)),ylim=c(min(V,na.rm=TRUE),max(V,na.rm=TRUE))) #Graph showing the variation in points sampled
#Superimpose on that graph the regression ls
	abline(ls$coefficients) 
	}
hist(h2.all) 
#Use a double-headed arrow so that out is a global variable not just a local variable
out<<-list(mean=mean(h2.all),sd=sd(h2.all)) 
out
	}

#Use �h2boot(tail)� to start the program on �tail�; hit �ESC� to end the cycle of boot plots
#but if you hit �ESC� the histogram and stats won�t appear
h2boot(tail)
